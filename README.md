# AoC_2024

Advent of Code 2024, using Rust.

To run the "demo" problem for a particular day (e.g. day 4), then run:

```bash
cargo run --release -- 4 demo
```

the demo problem is the "short" description problem that AoC gives to help you work through the problem and check your approach.

To run the actual test problem for a particular day, then run:

```bash
cargo run --release -- 4 test
```
